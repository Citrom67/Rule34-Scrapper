# Rule34-Scrapper
A JavaScript, more specifically a NodeJS Rule34 image downloader

## Dependencies
- [NodeJS (made with 17.3)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [readline-sync](github.com/anseki/readline-sync)

## How to run it
Once you have all the dependencies it should run just fine from a terminal with the ```node Scrapper.js``` command!

## Lore
I was kinda bored, but since I'm just learning JS, it's probably not the most efficient code, and made a few rookie mistakes so if you have any issues feel free to submit an issue or a pull request and I gonna try to keep it working, tho I don't think anything can really break now!
